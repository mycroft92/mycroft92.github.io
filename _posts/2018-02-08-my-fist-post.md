This is my first post on this blog and I thought I should write about my current favorite videogame [Duelyst](https://duelyst.com). For those of you who don't know , Duelyst is a turn-based strategy game that combines elements of card-based games(like Hearthstone) and board based games (like Chess). Each battle is a 1v1 between two online players. You choose a general from 6 different factions, each with their own unique abilities, minions and spells; and fight to reduce the opponent general's health to 0 from 25. The games have a lot of depth and are surprisingly fast too(each match last for an average of 10min). 

This is the current deck I am piloting as of called "tempo heal ziran" given [here]. This is arguably the best lyonar deck on the ladder right now and is super fun to play too. I am also piloting variants of this deck in the ongoing team wars. I will add more details about duelyst and the playstyle soon.
